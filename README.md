## Deliverables
### Project Deliverables

#### There are two deliverables that are required for project completion.
- A Github repository for your code.
- A blog post of your findings.

#### Your Github repository must have the following contents:

- A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.
- Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
- You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.

For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post. Your blog** **must provide the following:

- A clear and engaging title and image.
- Your questions of interest.
- Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.

_Note: The post should not dive into technical details or difficulties of the analysis; this should be saved for Github. The post should be understandable for non-technical people from many fields._
